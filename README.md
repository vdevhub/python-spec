# Recipe App - Command Line Version

## Overview
The Recipe App - Command Line Version is a simple app that allows the user to create recipes, store them in a local MySQL database, view, edit, and search recipes by ingredients as well as delete recipes. It is built with Python, MySQL, and SQLAlchemy. The app is fully controled via terminal. 

In this repository, the final application is stored in the `Exercise 1.7` folder. The resources in the other folders (Exercise 1.1 - 1.6) document the learning progress and partial deliverables leading to the final version.
