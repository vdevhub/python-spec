# Object-Oriented Programming in Python
The concept of OOP is applicable in Python and focuses on developing code through objects that interact with each other. Here we have an OOP version of the Recipe application.

## Details
1. Class Recipe is defined in the script that encapsulates a recipe's attributes and methods.
2. Getter and setter methods are defined to get and set a recipe's name, cooking time, difficulty (only get), and ingredients.
3. A specific string representation of the recipe is coded - operator overloading.
4. The app allows the user to search for recipes containing chosen ingredients and prints them out on the screen.
5. The list of all unique ingredients across all recipes and an all-recipes list is maintained.
6. This version doesn't feature any data storage.
